=====================================================
What is the 3SAT Problem?
-------------------------
We will explain the 3SAT problem with an example to help with the understanding.
It's actually a quite simple problem.
It involves a [boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean) function, *f*, with three boolean variables (the same kinds of variables in algebra).
We will call those variables var1, var2, and var3.
Suppose *f* is the function:
